# Using CFD Direct AWS

AWS provides [compute optimized](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Compute_Optimized) solutions for running numerical simulations on the cloud.

Using this service one can run [CFD Direct From the Cloud](https://cfd.direct/cloud/aws/) through instances of virtual machines.

Alternatively one may use more cost-effective [ARM processors](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/c6g-openfoam-better-price-performance/) to run the simulations.

Steps:
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Install [CFDDFC CLI](https://cfd.direct/cloud/aws/cli/install/)
