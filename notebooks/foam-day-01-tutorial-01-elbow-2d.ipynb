    "This series of [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com) tutorials is intended to be an extension of the classical [3-week series](https://wiki.openfoam.com/index.php?title=%223_weeks%22_series) but it is not limited to those cases. You are expected to have minimal *NIX* skills for dealing with commands in a Linux terminal and have basic knowledge of Python programming. For later tutorials some C++ knowledge is welcomed. Supported version is currently *v2106* of ESI extended version of OpenFOAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach to the management of OpenFOAM cases is provided here. Instead of creating cases as structured directories as expected by OpenFOAM, we reunite all the files in a Jupyter Notebook and we make use of Python for generating the project structure. This is intended to make navigation easier (recent versions of JupyterLab have a good *Table of Contents* navigation) and allow for easily generating experimental cases varying parameters. During the conception of these tutorials a Python package `foamutils` is developped to cover the required data manipulations. Please notice that there is already a [`PyFoam`](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/PyFoam) package for manipulating OpenFOAM data but it does not satify us as a *pythonic* package in terms of documentation and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this series we propose to *sysadmins* to consider hosting [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instances in host machines allowing access to OpenFOAM clusters/HPC for users to launch calculations based on our approach and provide VNC access for later visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `foamutils` is in active development while these tutorials are written, `autoreload` is enabled before the package is imported. This and other details regarding the import phase early in each tutorial will not be mentioned again in later tutorials. We also preconise defining the case name early in the notebook so that whenever we want to write a file this name is available for the root directory. Needless to say given this comments, basic OpenFOAM usage will be covered less and less as tutorials get more advanced, so following them in order is a requirement for beginners."

    "A particularity of OpenFOAM is the way these steps are organized and how the files are stored. Although you might conceive your own solver (as we will study later in this series) that does not respect strictly what is present next, you are highly discouraged to do so, otherwise it will look weird and difficult to learn for other OpenFOAM users. An OpenFOAM case is composed, at least, of the following directories:\n",
    "- `0/` (or zeros expressed in any precision you like, we discuss about that later eventually): this directory contains the boundary conditions and initial states for the patches defined in the mesh. Each physical field (pressure, velocity, temperature...) is defined in a sort of *dictionary* file, with one file per field. The required files vary from solver to solver depending on the modelled physics, but generally the naming convention is homogeneous so that velocity is `U` and pressure is `p`, for instance.\n",
    "- `constant/`: this directory hosts the generated mesh in a sub-directory `polyMesh` and other files corresponding to thermophysical properties of the fluids (transport properties, heat capacities, chemical kinetics,...), definitions regarding the turbulence modelling (but not the boundary conditions, which are found under `0/`), and other problem-specific files. One important file that might appear in some cases is `fvOptions`, through which we might provide heat sources, moving reference frames, etc.\n",
    "- `system/`: here go the solution control `controlDict` which is the entry point to the case, the selection of numerical schemes `fvSchemes` and the solver controls and convergence criteria in `fvSolution`. If geometry/meshing is done with OpenFOAM built-in tools, related files can also be found here. In multi-region simulations we might find sub-directories with `fvSchemes` and `fvSolutions` for different regions of the domain. Other files that might be here relate initialization of multi-phase simulations, partitioning for parallel computing, among others.\n",

    "The mesh is provided in `${FOAM_TUTORIALS}/resources/geometry/elbow.msh` and will later be copied to the case to convert to OpenFOAM format. In this case a `.msh` file generated with Gambit &reg; is used. The domain is composed of a large elbow with a main inlet `velocity-inlet-5` on the left side and a small channel inlet `velocity-inlet-6` coming from the bottom part. On the top we see the system outlet `pressure-outlet-7`. The other regions are treated as walls (main duct and inlet channel). A coarse mesh is used for a quick illustrative simulation. An important feature of OpenFOAM meshes that must be emphasized here is that the front and back planes `frontAndBackPlanes` in a 2D simulation as this must be separated by at least one cell over the domain thickness. In OpenFOAM a 0D simulation (`chemFoam`) is performed in a single 3D cell, 1D simulations are actually a stack of 3D cells, 2D meshes are actually extruded planes... and nothing needs to be said about 3D meshes. We will come back to this point later when we actually perform the meshing of another case.\n",

    "Since this is an incompressible solver, pressure is actually represented by the reduced pressure (pressure divided by density), thus its units are not in pascal, but $(m/s)^2$, as well as viscosity, as we see later, is provided by kinematic viscosity. With this we introduce you to the first element inside the body of any OpenFOAM conditions file, the `dimensions`, which is documented [here](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/2-openfoam-cases/2-2-basic-inputoutput-file-format). It is an array with the exponents used for each of the basic SI units. From the pressure units provided before, we guess that the second element represent length $L$ in meters and the third time $T$ in second seconds. The others will be presented later or you can read the link with the documentation.\n",

    "The second element of this file is the `internalField`, which provides the initial condition of the quantity in the volume. Here we declare the pressure to be `uniform` and equal to zero. It can also be `nonuniform` and provided for each cell in the mesh individually. That means that you can re-use solutions of simpler problems (for instance, approximate the velocity/pressure field in steady state) to initialize more complex problems, such as multiphase or enabling chemistry. This will be discussed in a more advanced case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we declare the `boundaryField`, which as it name says, provides the boundary conditions. All patches in de domain must be provided. In the case of pressure a common wall condition is `zeroGradient` meaning what its name say... and in the outlet `pressure-outlet-7` we provide a constant `fixedValue` a and `uniform` zero value reference pressure. Notice that when specifying inlets, it is common and physical to provide boundary conditions as zero gradient, meaning that the solver will find a compatible pressure with the imposed velocities.\n",
